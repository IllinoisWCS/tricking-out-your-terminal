check that the group's file is of the format

1. first commonality
2. second commonality
3. difference

if this is not the case, then try to help them resolve the issue. here is the code that they should have run, for reference:

touch awesome_group.txt
echo "1. first commonality" >> awesome_group.txt
echo "2. second commonality" >> awesome_group.txt
echo "3. difference" >> awesome_group.txt

if the file is correct, give them the following instructions:

rename the file to a nickname for your group (please check that this worked)
then have them navigate back to the root directory of the repo and run get_mission_two.sh

here is the code that they should have run, for reference:

mv awesome_group.txt group_name.txt
cd ..
bash get_mission_two.sh

once this is completed, give them the password to continue: onwards
