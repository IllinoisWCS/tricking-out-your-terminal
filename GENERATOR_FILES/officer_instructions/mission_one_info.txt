the group's file should be in the format

1. first commonality
2. second commonality
3. difference

if this is the case, then give them the following instructions:

rename the file to a nickname for your group (please check that this worked)
then navigate back to the root directory for the repo and run get_mission_two.sh

here is the code that they should have run, for reference:

mv awesome_group.txt group_name.txt
cd ..
sh get_mission_two.sh on mac/linux
bash get_mission_two.sh on windows

once this is completed, give them the password to continue: onwards

if this is not the case, then try to help them resolve the issue. here is the code that they should have run, for reference:

touch awesome_group.txt
echo "1. first commonality" >> awesome_group.txt
echo "2. second commonality" >> awesome_group.txt
echo "3. difference" >> awesome_group.txt
